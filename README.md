## Rock Paper Scissors -Multiplayer

This was a challenging assignment, but I think I enjoyed it the most so far. It did not require a lot of front-end coding. Majority of the development involved the logic to identify the winner, and handle the wins and losses. 

## Development Strategy

1. Once I had the images and the display for the wins and losses, I began working on the logic.
2. The first area of focus was to ensure taht the session was being created and deleted correctly for both players. 
3. Then I wrote the logic to ensure that the game could not begin when only one session was available (one player). 
4. Once both players had a session then I worked to capture their choices (RPS) and display them correctly. 
5. Then I worked on incrementing the losses and wins. 
6. My challenge was when the game needed to restart but I was able to figure it out. 

I used Firebase to capture the session information.
